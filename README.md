 # Brew  
### A AI-Powered Hackathon Idea, Team & Pitch Evaluation Platform

---

## Overview

**Brew** is a AI-powered web platform that helps hackathon teams **evaluate their idea, analyze team composition, and practice pitching**—before presenting to real judges.

Instead of static scores or generic feedback, Brew simulates a **real judging experience** using four AI judges with distinct perspectives. Teams receive structured feedback, participate in a mock pitch Q&A round, and receive a detailed evaluation report based on their responses.

Brew focuses on:
- Better idea validation  
- Stronger team formation  
- Confident and structured pitching
